# Hi there 👋

#### I'm Maciej Pieniążek and I am starting my IT career! 🥳

## 📜 About me 📜
  I study Computer Sciencie and Intelligent Systems on AGH in Cracow. 👨‍🎓
  
  I love GameDev as much as playing games 🎮 and I belive, that nowadays games are only the drop in the ocean of possible solutions. Thereupon I decided to create with my friends a research group 📈 on our uni.
  
  Besides my sciencie side, I am realy creative person 🤯
  
I would be happy to expand my knowledge.📈

## ⚙️ Projects 🔨

  ### 🎲 [DeadLandsNPCGenerator](https://github.com/empieniazek/DeadlandsNPCGenerator)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and my friends play RPG games. Sometimes the GM needs to spend couple of hours only on creating NPC's for the story.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me that he will appriciate some help with it.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't find specific NPC generator for our system ([DeadLands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlands)) so me and my friend [@vLesio](https://github.com/vLesio) are trying to create it on our own.
